# rand-dunn-gen
Contains the Random Dungeon Generator Files I made and the graphics module I used (made by John Zelle). The program does not immediately execute a main function upon running; instead, it is intended to be run in IDLE or a similar IDE in which the user can execute function calls in the Shell. The relevant functions are towards the end of the module after all of the classes. The textMain() function is a text-based interface and is reccommended; calls directly to main() can also be used. The GUI, accessed through guiMain(), is a work in progress and does not yet have the full functionality of textMain(). When using this software, put the graphics package in a place where Python can see it, and put the other files in a place where it is convenient to run them.
